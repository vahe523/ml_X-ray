In this project, we explore a dataset with x-ray images of Normal chest and with Pneumonia. The purpose of the project is to find a decently working model that predicts whether human's chest is normal or with pneumonia.  This means that we should use a classifier model for our project. Since our data unbalanced we will use data augmentation. The three models we will build are Sequantial neural network, Model Subclassing, and Transfer learning. The final results show that the best performing model is the model with Transfer learning and it actually performs best among our models for all the measured metrics.
